      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>Provide our service to you</b>
        <div>Most of the time, the reason we process your information is to perform the contract that you have with

        <br />

        <div>From time to time, we may ask for your consent to use your information for certain specific reasons.
You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.</div>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <br />
      <b>How We Share Information</b>
      <div>We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various tasks,
including data hosting and maintenance, analytics and security operations.</div>
      <br />
      <div>We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For
instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners.</div>
      <br />
      <div>We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner. All of our
service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.</div>
      <br />
      <div>We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court
order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii)
to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the
safety of any person.</div>
      <br />
      <div>We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii)
as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested
parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding
illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Push notifications</b>
      <div>The app can notify you of certain news via push notifications, even if you are not actively using the app at the
time. The app only uses these push notifications if you have explicitly activated them. The legal basis is Article 6,
paragraph 1(a) of the GDPR.</div>
      <br />
      <div>When you activate the push notification service, a so-called device token from Apple or a so-called registration
ID from Google is assigned to your device. The sole purpose of their use by us is to provide the push services.
Without a device token or registration ID, no push messages can be sent to you for technical reasons. These
identifiers are only encrypted, randomly generated numbers.</div>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>Notes for Apple users:</b>
        <div>In order to be notified of certain events and topics via push notifications, even if you are not currently
using the app, you must grant the app the necessary permission. Without your consent, which you give
by activating it in the settings, we cannot send you a push message. The first time you log in to the app,
you will be asked if you want to allow push notifications. You can then adjust the permissions for push
notifications in the iOS settings and turn push notifications on or off at any time later.</div>
        <br />
        <div>To do this, open the &quot;Settings&quot; app of iOS and select the menu item &quot;Messages&quot;. In the following menu
you will find an overview of all apps that are installed on your device and that have a push notification
function. Select our app here. Here you can switch the push notification function on or off. You also
have the option of customising the display of push notifications in the app according to your
preferences.</div>
        <br />
        <b>Notes for Android users:</b>
        <div>On Android, all apps are set by default so that you can receive push notifications even if you do not have
the app open. Unfortunately, this cannot be avoided due to Google&#39;s technical specifications, over which
we have no influence. The app will not use this permission without your permission. You will only
receive push notifications if you explicitly activate this function in the app.</div>
        <br />
        <div>Within the app, you can deactivate the push services you have activated at any time. Independently of
the settings in the app, you can also switch off the receipt of push notifications by calling up the app
&quot;Settings&quot; in the main menu of your device and selecting the item &quot;Apps&quot; in the following menu item.
There you will find an overview of all apps installed on your device. Select our app here. You can then
switch the push notification function on or off by ticking &quot;Show notifications&quot;.</div>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <b>Evaluation of user behaviour</b>
      <div>This app uses &quot;Firebase Services&quot; (Firebase), an analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon
House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (&quot;Google&quot;). Firebase enables us to analyse the usage behaviour of the
users of this app. The insights gained from this help us to improve this app and thus make your user experience
more pleasant. Firebase is a real-time database that we use for real-time data exchange and storage. This
involves the transfer of user data to Firebase.</div>
      <br />
      <div>Some Firebase services process personal data. In most cases, the personal data is limited to so-called &quot;instance
IDs&quot;, which are provided with a time stamp. These &quot;Instance IDs&quot; assigned by Firebase are unique and thus allow
linking of different events or processes. We process this aggregated data to analyse and optimise usage
behaviour, such as by evaluating crash reports. The legal basis for the processing is Article 6, paragraph 1(b) of
the GDPR, which states that the data is necessary for the performance of our service.</div>
      <br />
      <div>For Firebase Analytics, Google also uses the advertising ID of the mobile device in addition to the &quot;instance ID&quot;
described above. You can restrict the use of the advertising ID in the device settings of your mobile device.</div>
      <br />
      <div><b>For Android:</b> Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Reset Ad ID</div>
      <div><b>For iOS:</b> Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Advertising &gt; No Ad Tracking</div>
      <br />
      <div>Firebase Cloud Messaging is used to send push messages or so-called in-app messages (messages that are only
displayed within the respective app). A pseudonymised push reference is assigned to the end device, which
serves as the target for the push messages or in-app messages. You can find more information in the above
section &quot;Push messages&quot;.</div>
      <br />
      <div>The data generated in this context may be transferred by Google to a server in the USA for analysis and stored
there. Furthermore, we have concluded several supplementary agreements on data processing with Google.</div>
      <br />
      <div>You can find more information on data protection at Google and Firebase at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/</a>.</div>
      <br />
      <b>With your consent or at your request</b>
      <div>We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear
why we want to share the information.</div>
      <br />
      <div>We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you
are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioural data, geolocation in de-identified
form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above
circumstances. We may also share this information with third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and
deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyse and
report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or
personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Advertising</b>
      <div>Advertisers and third parties also may collect information about your activity on our sites and applications, on
devices associated with you, and on third-party sites and applications using tracking technologies. Tracking data
collected by these advertisers and third parties is used to decide which ads you see both on our sites and
applications and on third-party sites and applications. You can opt out on the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
if you wish not to receive targeted advertising. You may also be able to choose to control targeted advertising on
other websites and platforms that you visit. In addition, you may also choose to control targeted advertising you
receive within applications by using the settings and controls on your devices.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Your Rights</b>
      <div>We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following:</div>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <div>Information, deletion and correction</div>
        <div>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free
information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing
and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further
questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</div>
        <br />
        <div>Right to restriction of processing</div>
        <div>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose,
you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</div>
        <br />
        <div>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For
the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
personal data.</div>
        <div>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the
restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</div>
        <br />
        <div>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you
have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.</div>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <b>Updating your information</b>
      <div>If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it
and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us at.</div>
      <br />
      <div>For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we
can answer the above requests.</div>
      <br />
      <div>Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe
on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information
relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the
other user will have to contact us to provide their written consent before the information is released.</div>
      <br />
      <b>How Long We Retain Your Information</b>
      <div>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted
by applicable law. To protect the safety and security of our users on and off our services, we implement a safety
retention window of three months following account deletion. During this period, account information will be
retained although the account will of course not be visible on the services any more.</div>
      <br />
      <div>In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety
retention window) or after two years of continuous inactivity, unless:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some “traffic data” is kept for one year to
comply with statutory data retention obligations);</li>
        <li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents, Privacy
Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);</li>
        <li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is
resolved;</li>
        <li>or the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing
users’ safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was
banned for unsafe behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to
the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time frame due to
technical constraints.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <div>Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information,
notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you any more.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Transfer to processors within the scope of Art. 28 GDPR</b>
      <div>In the IT area, we work together with processors (Art. 28 GDPR) who process your data for us in accordance
with your instructions. If we commission service providers to fulfil our tasks, we always observe the provisions of
data protection law; in particular, data is only passed on after the conclusion of contracts for commissioned
processing.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Disclosure due to a legal obligation</b>
      <div>In the event of a legal or official obligation, we will pass on your data to public bodies or institutions (authorities,
for example in the context of criminal prosecution).</div>
      <br />
      <b>Uninstall</b>
      <div>You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your
device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will
continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate
this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Integration Of Services And Contents Of Third Parties</b>
      <div>We use within our online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR), content or
services offered by third-party providers in order to integrate their content and services.</div>
      <br />
      <div>This always requires that the third-party providers of this content are aware of your IP address, since the content
or service could not send to your browser without the IP address. The IP address is thus required for the display
of this content and we endeavor to use providers that only use your IP address for the delivery of the content or
services. However, Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as &quot;web
beacons&quot;) for statistical or marketing purposes. The &quot;pixel tags&quot; can be used to evaluate information such as
visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the
user&#39;s device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating
system, referring websites, time of visit and other information about the use of our online offer, as well as be
linked to such information from other sources.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Hosting</b>
      <div>The services for hosting and displaying the web app are partly provided by our service providers as part of
processing on our behalf. Unless otherwise explained in this privacy policy, all access data and all data collected
in forms provided for this purpose on this web app are processed on their servers. If you have any questions
about our service providers and the basis of our relationship with them, please contact them as described in this
privacy policy.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Content Delivery Network</b>
      <div>For the purpose of a shorter loading time, we use a so-called Content Delivery Network (&quot;CDN&quot;) for some offers.
With this service, content, e.g. large media files, are delivered via regionally distributed servers of external CDN
service providers. Therefore, access data is processed on the servers of the service providers. Our service
providers work for us within the framework of order processing. If you have any questions about our service
providers and the basis of our cooperation with them, please use the contact option described in this privacy
policy.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Online presences in social media</b>
      <div>We maintain online presences in social networks and platforms on the basis of our legitimate interests within
the meaning of Article 6 lit. f) GDPR and in order to communicate with customers, interested parties and users
who are active there. Unless otherwise stated in this policy, we process the data of users if they communicate
with us within the social networks and platforms, e.g. write articles on our online presences or send us
messages.</div>
      <br />
      <b>Social Media Functions and Widgets</b>
      <div>Within our online offer, functions and widgets of social networks and platforms
are integrated. When you click on or use any of those functions and widgets, your browser establishes
a direct connection to the relevant social networks and platforms. The function or widget then transmits
log data to the relevant social networks and platforms. This log data may contain your IP address, the
address of the visited websites, type and settings of the browser, date and time of the request, your
usage of the relevant social networks and platforms, as well as cookies. Those may also include the
display of our post, the link to our profile, the possibility to interact with the posts and functions, as well
as to measure users reach (so-called conversion measurement).</div>
      <br />
      <b>Changes</b>
      <div>Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you making the best use of our services, this
policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time
to review the changes.</div>
      <br />
      <b>How To Contact Us</b>
      <div>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the details provided.</div>
